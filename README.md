# ⚙️ Development Tools and Setup

### Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. These tools are configured to run automatically before each commit using Husky and lint-staged.

### Linting

You can manually check for linting issues by running:

`npm run lint`

### Code Formatting

You can manually format the code using Prettier by running:

`npm run format`

### Pre-commit Hook

When making a commit, Husky runs a pre-commit hook that triggers lint-staged. This ensures that:

- ESLint checks for linting issues in staged files (\*.js) before committing.
- Prettier automatically formats JavaScript and JSON files before they are committed.
