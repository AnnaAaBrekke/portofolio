# ⚙️ Development Tools and Setup
### Code Formatting and Linting
This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. These tools are configured to run automatically before each commit using Husky and lint-staged.

### Linting
You can manually check for linting issues by running:

`
npm run lint
`
### Code Formatting
You can manually format the code using Prettier by running:

`
npm run format
`
### Pre-commit Hook
When making a commit, Husky runs a pre-commit hook that triggers lint-staged. This ensures that:
- ESLint checks for linting issues in staged files (*.js) before committing.
- Prettier automatically formats JavaScript and JSON files before they are committed.
